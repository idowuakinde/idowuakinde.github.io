          I learnt to program in GWBasic - my first programming language - in 1997, but didn't start to code professionally (in a commercial context) until 2000. Since then, I've played various roles in the broad areas of software development and (more recently) digital product development.
        </p>
        <p>
          These roles have ranged from analysis, design, architecture, engineering, post-engineering review, integration, deployment, support (technical as well as non-technical), management, leadership and coaching of various digital product teams (spanning in commercial value from (small) 10,000-USD-per-annum products to (medium-size) 5m-USD-per-annum products).
        </p>
        <p>          
          Having achieved some degree of success (?) over the last 20 years, my goal for the next 20, is to nurture (coach, mentor, inspire) the next generation of tech talent.

  My 20-year goal - starting from 2020 - is to nurture (coach, mentor, inspire) the next generation of tech talent.
 </p>
 <p>
  To this end, I currently coach product teams, technology teams, and startup teams across the globe, both in a paid capacity (through Boolean Labs) and in a volunteer capacity (through the Founder Institute, the Impact Hub, BridgeForBillions, VC4Africa and the Innovation Support Network).
