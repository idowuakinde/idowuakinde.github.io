          I learnt to program in GWBasic - my first programming language - in 1997, but didn't start to code professionally until 2000. Since then, I've played various roles in the broad areas of software development and (more recently) digital product development.
        </p>
        <p>
          These roles have ranged from analysis, design, architecture, engineering, post-engineering review, integration, deployment, support (technical as well as non-technical), management, leadership and coaching of various digital product teams (spanning in commercial value from (small) $10,000-per-annum products to (medium-size) $5m-per-annum products).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">          
          My goal for the next 20 years - having achieved some degree of success over the last - is to nurture (coach, mentor, inspire) the next generation of tech talent.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
          To this end, I currently coach product teams, technology teams, and startup teams across the globe. Working through global technology-innovation hubs such as the Founder Institute, Impact Hub, BridgeForBillions, VC4Africa and Innovation Support Network, sometimes this coaching manifests as an Agile Coach, and other times as Product Coach, Technology Coach, Developer Advocate, Technical Evangelist or Startup Mentor.

          If you'd like to discuss what I could do for your team, how I could add value to your product-development effort, or a mutually-beneficial collaboration, then let's chat:
