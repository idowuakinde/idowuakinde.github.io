          I learnt to program in GWBasic - my first programming language - in 1997, but didn't start to code professionally (in a commercial context) until 2000. Since then, I've played various roles in the broad areas of software development and (more recently) digital product development.
        </p>
        <p>
          These roles have ranged from analysis, design, architecture, engineering, post-engineering review, integration, deployment, support (technical as well as non-technical), management, leadership and coaching of various digital product teams (spanning in commercial value from (small) 10,000-USD-per-annum products to (medium-size) 5m-USD-per-annum products).
        </p>
        <p>          
          Having achieved some degree of success (?) over the last 20 years, my goal for the next 20, is to nurture (coach, mentor, inspire) the next generation of tech talent.
        </p>
        <p>          
          To this end, I coach: 1) product teams, 2) technology teams, and 3) startup teams on various aspects of product development, technology and startup building, both in a paid capacity through Boolean Labs and in a volunteer capacity through the Founder Institute, the Impact Hub, VC4Africa and (Innovation Support Network).
        </p>
